Homework from the seventh week of the Spring Boot 2 course.

The application from the GUI level allows you to add and display 
all cars from the database. The car model is represented by mark, 
model, color and year of production. You can also view cars 
from the database by specifying the date range of production.

The application connects to the MySQL database using JDBC.
